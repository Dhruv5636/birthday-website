# Birthday Surprise Website Instructions

Hello! Your romantic website is ready.

## How to Customize

1. **Open the `birthday_surprise` folder.**
2. **Edit `config.js`:**
   - Open this file in any text editor (Notepad, VS Code, etc.).
   - Change the names, messages, and dates inside the quotes.
   - Save the file.

3. **Add Photos:**
   - Put your actual photos (jpg, png) into the `images` folder.
   - Go back to `config.js` and find `galleryImages`.
   - Change `"image1.svg"` to the name of your new photo, e.g., `"myphoto.jpg"`.

4. **Add Music:**
   - Put your mp3 file in the `music` folder.
   - In `config.js`, update `backgroundMusic` to point to your file (e.g., `"music/mysong.mp3"`).

## How to View
Double-click `index.html` to open it in your browser. 
To test on mobile, you need to host it or use a local server, but you can test the "mobile view" in Chrome on your desktop by pressing F12 and clicking the phone icon.

Happy Birthday to your special someone! ❤️
